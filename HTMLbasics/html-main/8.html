    <h4>The 40-Year War in the Arabian Peninsula</h4>
    
    <p>The story of Al-Zeer Salem is one of the most important and fertile popular biographies, named Balzir for his
        love for fun and women, yet he became a great leader and hero, and moved his lamentation and crying over the
        killing of his brother "Kulaib" tribal customs and pre-Islamic pride, igniting a fierce war that lasted 40 years
        called the Bassous War.
        The war between the Taghlib and Bani Murra tribes began after the killing of Kulaib bin Rabia by his cousin
        al-Jassas at the instigation of al-Basous.
        "Al-Basous" is the sister of the King of Yemen, who was killed by "Kulaib" because he wanted to marry Jalila,
        his cousin and fiancée at the time.
        In revenge for her brother, "Al-Basous" came disguised as an old poet praising princes and poets, including
        "Al-Jassas", so he stuck to her and asked her to be a guest of him, so she and her camel went down to him
        "Mirage".
        Al-Basous asked two slaves to take her camel to Kulaib's orchard. The camel wreaked havoc in the orchard and
        Kulaib killed her with his spear.
        Al-Bassous was outraged by the killing of her camel and incited Al-Jassas to kill Kulaib, so Al-Jassas went out
        after him and killed him. Al-Zeer Salem decided to avenge his brother Kulaib and avenge him against his cousins
        and declared war.
        In one of the fierce battles of Al-Bassous, Al-Zeer Salem met a young man who was unable to defeat him, and soon
        discovered that he was the "puppy", the son of "Kulaib", whom his venerable mother named "Hajras" and raised him
        in the fever of his uncle Al-Jassas, the killer of his father, and he was hated by his uncle Al-Zir Salem.
        The puppy knew the truth about his uncle Al-Zir Salem and realized that his uncle Al-Jassas was the one who
        killed his father, so he planned a trick with his uncle and gave him a blood bag to be frightened by Al-Zeer
        under his arm and pretended that the puppy stabbed him.
        After pretending to "Al-Zeer Salem" that he was stabbed, Al-Jassas abandoned his caution, so Al-Zeer Salem and
        the puppy were able to finish him off and cut off his head, thus ending the puppy and Al-Zeer Salem conflict
        between the tribes and revenge for Kulaib.
