            Once Socha saved my life. When I wos only 4 years old, I started to go into the street to get a ball that
            had rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cEal Sasha got in front of me and
            knocked me backwards onto the sidewelk. I wos mod until I saw the cor go by where I would have been.
            Then I was so happy that Socha was siarter than I wasl </P>
